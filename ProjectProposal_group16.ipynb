        "\n",
        "Our topic investigates the relationship between traffic accidents reported to the police (in areas around UCSD) and the time at which they occur relative to the academic calendar followed by the UCSD quarter system. Although the occurrence of traffic accidents are variable, it is interesting to find out which weeks in the UCSD quarter system are statistically likely to have more traffic accidents in the area around UCSD. This could segue into an analysis of the different reasons behind why certain weeks may or may not have more traffic accidents than other weeks.\n",
        "\n",
        "After doing our initial research, we currently know that there is existing data publicly available online regarding the traffic incidents reported to the police, and this data contain precise timestamps along with other information related to the severity of the accident. Furthermore, we are planning to focus on the UCSD academic calendar, so we will match the timestamp data with the corresponding week of the UCSD calendar. Since we are planning to analyze accidents in areas near UCSD, we plan to use information such as the address or geographical coordinates of the accident to only consider the accidents near the UCSD area within a set radius.\n",

        "#### Explanation of what work has been done previously:\n",
        "\n",
        "There has been previous work examining traffic accidents around UCLA, UC Berkeley, and California State University, Sacramento [^anastasia2014], and this includes both police reported and self-reported accidents in collision \"hotspot\" areas that are popularly known to have a lot of traffic accidents. The main results from the work of Anastasia et. al. were that traffic accidents were most prevalent in \"campus activity hubs, campus access hubs, and through traffic hubs\". However, the paper does not analyze any correlation between time and the occurrence of such accidents. Furthermore, the paper mentioned that there is a significant underreporting of crashes.\n",
        "\n",
        "The work of [^tsai2019] analyzes traffic collisions in the San Diego area and identifies which days of the week tend to have more collisions. Their conclusion was that the number of injuries was greatest on Friday and the number of deaths was greatest on Monday. However, there were no statistical tests performed to verify that these trends were significant and there were issues with the times of the accident being imprecise. Our project hopes to resolve these issues.\n",
        "\n",
        "The work of S. Rawat [^rawat2020] performs data analysis on traffic accident dataset covering the USA. The work concluded that visibility and weather conditions did not significantly affect the presence of road accidents. The work also visualized the number of road accidents as a function of time in years, showing how the number of accidents of each severity level have increased from 2015 to 2019. Our project, however, hopes to dive deeper into the variation in the number of accidents over a single quarter of the UCSD academic calendar.\n",

        "#### Ethical Considerations Summary\n",
        "\n",
        "We plan to primarily use data collected by the police with regards to the accidents and fatalities.\n",
        "\n",
        "There are quite a few concerns regarding the data collection practices of the police in regards to the public datasets we're using. One such ethical concern is how much data is being collected from the police, since the data being collected may have personal information of gender, ethnicity, age, geographical pinpoint on where they live. It's possible that the information about accidents could be combined with other public data to get the identities of people in said accidents. Moreover, people reporting their accidents to the police may believe that this information is confidential, similar to criminal records, and as such are not giving their informed consent to this information being shared. Furthermore, there is collection bias based on certain demographics perhaps being more likely to commit hit-and-runs, since afterall, we only know what the police does.\n",
        "\n",
        "However, since we're not the ones responsible for the collection of this data and do not have the authority to add or remove data from these datasets, all we can do to ensure data privacy is not keep copies of the datasets internally for longer than necessary and never publish a copy of the dataset online. Rather, if necessary to prove credibility for our analyses, we should opt to cite the dataset, so that in case the SDPD decide to remove these datasets upon data privacy concerns, we do not engage in the proliferation of this content against their consent.\n",
